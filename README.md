## 👻 Why Called Jenova?
I've received some amusing comments about the project name, so here's the backstory. Although I'm a huge FF7 fan, the name isn’t directly linked to Final Fantasy. Jenova is derived from 'Jehovah,' meaning 'New God.' I chose this name because Godot translates to 'Small God.' Therefore, in this context, Jenova signifies a new god emerging from a small god. Additionally, it means 'Well-Born'

Now, why Jenova and J.E.N.O.V.A? The answer is straightforward. Name formatting like this was popular in the 2000s, similar to F.E.A.R. or A.K.I.R.A. It doesn't reference anything specific. However, it's worth noting that Projekt J.E.N.O.V.A refers to the entire toolchain, which includes the Framework, Runtime, Emulator, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Jenova Only Supports Godot 4.2+, Windows 7 to 11 x64, Linux and Mac support are not planned for now.
> At the moment Jenova only provides MSVC Support, However you can use Visual Studio directly.
> If you need C++ Scripting with support of Linux or Mac you can use [Godot Sandbox](https://github.com/libriscv/godot-sandbox).

> [!NOTE]  
> Current builds doe not include the Virtual Machine and Emulator. While the code for these features is present, they are disabled because they are still heavily under development.

> [!CAUTION]
> Current builds are in Alpha stage, Backup your project files! You may end up with data loss!
